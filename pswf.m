function [P, V] = pswf(N, c, dom, flag)
%PSWF   Prolate spheroidal wave functions.
% P = PSWF(N, C) computes a CHEBFUN representing the Nth prolate spheroidal
% wavefunction (PSWF) with bandwidth C on the interval [-1,1]. C must be a
% scalar but N may be a vector of integers, in which case the output is
% an array-valued CHEBFUN with NUMEL(N) columns. 
%
% P = PSWF(N) is as above, but with assumption that C = max(N).
%
% P = PSWF(N, C, DOM) computes the PSWFs as above, but scaled to the interval 
% DOM, which must be a finite two-vector.
%
% [P, V] = PSWF(...) returns also a the matrix of Legendre coefficients for
% the computed PSWF. V = PSWF(N, C, DOM, 'coeffs') returns only the
% coefficient matrix and not the CHEBFUN P.
